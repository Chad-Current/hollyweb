      <li class='bottomr-red'>World class puppies. Only Breeding the Best German/American Champion bloodlines for 67 years. We breed working and conformation lines dedicated to the proposition of total soundness of mind and body. All breeding stock is "a" stamped and OFA'd (certified hips and elbows) at 24 months of age. All of our German Shepherds are health guaranteed with breeder support for the Lifetime of the dog. Our Breeding Stock is protected by our guarantees as well as our commitment to maintaining a wonderful dog/owner relationship. We choose the right puppy for your home and family based on the drive of the puppy, taking into consideration if the dog will be a show, performance, service, therapy, or companion home. We maintain lifetime support and will accept our dogs back for any reason. If the puppy is a local purchase, the dog would have to attend our dog obedience classes. We are available day or night to speak with you about any and all health, behavior, obedience or house training concerns. Lutzhaus puppies start at $1500 and go up from there, there is a deposit of $500 to secure a puppy from the litter. Puppies are evaluated at 8-10 weeks, priced, and then sent to their new forever homes.
